## Usage

```php
use \TypistTech\WordfenceAPI\{Client, Feed, Record};

$client = new Client;

// Alternatively, use `Feed::Scanner`` for the scanner feed.
$records = $client->fetch(Feed::Production);

foreach($records as $record) {
    /** @var Record $record */
    echo $record->title;
}
```

## Installation

```bash
composer require typisttech/wordfence-api
```

## Known Issues


### `Allowed memory size of 999999 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 99 bytes)`

> [!TIP]
> Set `memory_limit` on the fly as a temporary fix:
>
> ```bash
> php -d memory_limit=512MB your-script.php
> ```

As of December 2024, the [production Wordfence vulnerability data feed](https://www.wordfence.com/api/intelligence/v2/vulnerabilities/production) is over 80 MB.
[`Client`](src/Client.php) downloads the feed into memory and `json_decode()` the entire feed all in one go. 
It causes PHP to run out of memory.

A possible solution is to use a streaming JSON parser like [`json.Decoder`](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#example-Decoder.Decode-Stream) in Go.
If you know how to do that in PHP, please send pull requests. :bow:
